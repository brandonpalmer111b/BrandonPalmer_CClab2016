## Overview Week 4
Arduino

### Homework Assignment

#### IDE Arduino circut 

#### youtube Video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwkh6Jp_RHU&feature=youtu.be



#### CITATIONS for reference and learning

 CClab, IDE examples, lynda.com, Haywyre Everchanging

#### Proposal
 Create a circut using Arduino. Make multiple lights flash

#### Errors
I had issues trying to create new buttons. So I had stuck with using one button for multiple leds. I would like to be able to replicate some of the light features and hook them up to an led strip. 

#### Learning process
Lynda.com helped me understand resistors. It had broke the math down into steps which allowed me to understand the difference between higher ohms and lower. Also I thought it would be fun to try and learn how to video edit. The video is basic, but I found editing fun and addicting.

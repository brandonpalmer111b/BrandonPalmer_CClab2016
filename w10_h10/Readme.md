#### Proposal
Create an audio reactive shape that interacts with sound. 

#### Errors
I had issues with creating a shape that changes its colors. When I used the random function, the colors would only change based on different tones of gray.  

#### Learning process
I had learned how to import text and audio while creatign shapes that interact with the mp3 track. Also I learned how to use the basics of OpenFrameworks. I still had alot to learn, but I know where to find some good resources to get started.

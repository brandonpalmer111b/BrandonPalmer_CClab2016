#### Proposal
 According to “ny.com” New York City subways has an estimated total of 4.3 million people who use the transit each day. The customers are constantly traveling in and out throughout the day to get to their jobs, classes and homes. The underground can range from 90deg-100degs in the summer months. With this extreme temperature issue, MTA customers suffer through excruciating heat exhaustion while traveling. The trains themselves have air condition, but on the outside platform were customers wait to enter the trains do not. The trains also leave exhaust from their motors which cause the temperature to slightly rise. Since customers are dependent on the metro systems as a main source of travel, it is paramount that the subway systems are kept cool to keep civilians safe from passing out from the expected heat. 	How might we help people stay safe by keeping cool while commuting through the metro stations? By creating innovated distance tracking fans, built into the ceilings above the platforms. People will stay cool, and commute safely while using this interactive installation. 

#### Errors
I had a hard time syncing up my ultrasonic sensor to the dc motor. I had first started with using the calibration example, and then tried to connect the trigger and echo pin. But this method didn't work. So I back tracked and got some help in tutoring where we connected the sensor as the input first, then connected the dc motor to pin 9 as the output. Allowing the sensor to read up to 30cm away. The soldering method also had gave me some difficulty. 

#### Learning process
Lynda.com was how I got more farmiliar with setting up the 12v dc motor. Also the girl from tinkersphere had told me to buy a relay which I did. But ended up using a transitor instead.

## Overview Week 1
Javascript

### Homework Assignment

#### Interactive List 



#### CITATIONS for reference and learning

 Codecademy JQuery

#### Proposal
For this weeks homework we had to create an interactive list using javascript. I had followed through Codecademeys JQuery course in-order to understand how to create interactive lists. 

#### Errors
I had issues were the viwer would see the img become hidden once they entered the page. I had tried playing around with the document.ready setup. But for some odd reason the img is still display right before it hides. 

#### Learning process
Codecademy had helped me a great amount with this project. If I could go back, I would have liked to start off with Lynda tutorials first then moved into codecademy, because I feel like I would make better sense once I reached the html and css elements section in the JQuery course.

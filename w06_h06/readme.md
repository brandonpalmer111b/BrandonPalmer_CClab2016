#### CITATIONS for reference and learning

CClab, IDE examples, Madchild "Monster", Bootcamp Code for Processing, Firmata

#### Proposal
 Create a circut board that allows the user to minipulate a processing sketch using a joystick 

#### Errors
I had issues with the functionality of my joystick. Also it took me a long time to get my serial number to sync up to processing. 

#### Learning process
I had to play around with old sketches from bootcamp that my friend Aim had done in her section. It was a good way to review code from different sections and learn how to implement and redefine the code into my own sketch.

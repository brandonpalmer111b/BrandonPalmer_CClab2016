#Javascript Api
## week 3 homework
####CClab | Brandon Palmer
#####The Mission 

For this weeks homework, we were asked to create an interactive api that demostrated data visualization. 

#####Process
I had followed the Lynda.com tutorial on Google Api. All of my code has been referenced from watching lyndas videos, and has been documented from Google API. In conclusion to watching the tutorials, I had tried to host Googles Api maps onto my local server.

#####Problems
My main issues with the maps were placing in multple markers. Once the markers had been placed, the transition between clicking and having the locations pop up were minimal. Sometimes it would work, and other times not. These were my main bugs in the api. I had left the multiple markers to indicate what I had been trying to acheive. But they only work when clicked or zoomed in real close. 

#####Further Steps

Create a panoramic perspective of googles api. This could potentially be placed inside my website. Overall I felt that Google api was streight forward, their website made it easy to navigate.

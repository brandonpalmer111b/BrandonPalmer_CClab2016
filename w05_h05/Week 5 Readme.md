#### CITATIONS for reference and learning

 CClab, IDE examples, The Notorious BIG ft. Ja Rule - Old Thing Back (Matoma Remix, http://circuitcellar.com (Blue Print used as background)

#### Proposal
 Create a circut using Arduino without a breadboard. Hook up the circut to a working sensor and an Led using the same code from class. 

#### Errors
I had issues with the functionality of my photoresistor. So I had used my force sensor instead and hooked that up. 

#### Learning process
I had looked up diagrams online that showed how to set up a force sensor to the breadboard. Once the breadboard circut had worked, I then took the wires appart and configured the circut to work without the breadboard by soldering the wires together.
